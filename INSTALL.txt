--- Rakuten Checkout module for Oxid 4.6 ---
--------------------------------------------

          INSTALLATION MANUAL

1. Copy contents from folder "copy_this" to the root of your Oxid store;

2. Merge template from "changed_full" folder with the one that currently exists in your store,
   or if you haven't modified out/admin/tpl/order_main.tpl, out/admin/tpl/order_overview.tpl
   and out/basic/tpl/page/checkout/basket.tpl in your store you can just overwrite it with the
   version from the module, "template.patch" is also provided for your convenience, so it'll be
   easier to track changes you should apply manually to the template. Note that you do NOT need
   to upload patch to the server if you plan just to overwrite the template;

3. Go to the admin -> Extensions -> Modules Rakuten Checkout, activate the module;

4. Go to the admin -> Shop Settings -> Rakuten Checkout, enable and configure the module;

5. Enjoy!
